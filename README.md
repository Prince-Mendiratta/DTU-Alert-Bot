## ENVironment VARiables

#### Mandatory Environment Variables

* `TG_BOT_TOKEN`: Create a bot using [@BotFather](https://telegram.dog/BotFather), and get the Telegram API token.

* `APP_ID`,
* `API_HASH`: Get these two values from [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps).

* `AUTH_CHANNEL`:
Go to [@Rose](https://telegram.dog/MissRose_bot), send /id in the chat to get this value.

* `MONGO_URL`: You can get this value by creating a cluster on [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) and getting the connection url.
- __Note__ You MUST enter 0.0.0.0/0 in the allowed ip addresses range in your cluster.

#### Optional Environment Variables

* `TG_BOT_WORKERS`: Number of workers to use. 4 is the recommended (and default) amount, but your experience may vary.
 __Note__ that going crazy with more workers won't necessarily speed up your bot, given the amount of sql data accesses, and the way python asynchronous calls work.

* `COMMM_AND_PRE_FIX`: The command prefix. Telegram, by default, recommeds the use of `/`, which is the default prefix. ~~Please don't change this unless you know what you're doing.~~

* `START_COMMAND`: The command to check if the bot is alive, or for users to start the robot.

* `START_OTHER_USERS_TEXT`: The message that your bot users would see on sending /start message.

* `ONLINE_CHECK_START_TEXT`: The message that the bot administrators can use to check if bot is online.

* `HELP_MEHH`: The message that bot users would see on sending /help message.

* `TZ`: Timezone to make sure time related functions work as required.

* `LOG_FILE_ZZGEVC`: The path to store log files.
